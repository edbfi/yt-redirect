# Development CI

Every PR, default-branch push and manual `ci.yml` dispatch runs the same checks.
The required `ci / required` aggregate rejects failed, cancelled, missing and
skipped prerequisites. Workflow validation is read-only and rejects tracked-file
mutations. The shared gate, smoke, policy and Biome repair use versioned releases of
`edbfi/automation`; all external action references use full version tags.

The quality lane runs complementary prek hygiene and stack guards, read-only
Biome, actual type checks, applicable unit tests, a static build and applicable
bundle budget. It uploads one `site-dist` artifact. HTTP smoke and browser lanes
consume those exact bytes, so they neither rebuild nor accidentally test a dev
server. Frozen installs use packageManager's Bun version and a lockfile-keyed cache.
`ci.yml` owns application checks. The independent PR policy workflow also reacts to
label, title and review changes; other check workflows are callable lanes.

Converter unit tests, Danish server-rendered controls, language persistence and appearance/browser tests remain required.

Reproduce locally: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, then
`SKIP=no-commit-to-branch,biome,build prek run --all-files --hook-stage manual`,
`bash .github/scripts/check.sh`, and `bash .github/scripts/smoke.sh`.
Where a browser suite exists, install its Playwright browsers and run
`CI=true bun run test:e2e` after the build. Keep port 4321 free for these checks.
Prek's Biome and build hooks are skipped only because explicit CI steps cover them;
the default-branch hook applies to local commits. No existing stack guards are removed.

The shared Renovate preset includes the official Biome schema manager and isolates
Biome/TypeScript/prek groups. Biome repair computes changes without write permission,
then a separate publisher validates the allowed paths and live PR head before
committing. The App-authored push starts the normal `pull_request` CI and policy
runs on the new SHA; nothing is dispatched. Existing template formatting
exclusions remain in force. TypeScript updates exercise both Astro and Svelte
checks without a separate version cap. Incompatible updates remain unmerged.

Shared automation uses immutable `v4.0.0` references. Renovate owns dependency
PR merging through the shared `automerge.json` preset: it arms GitHub auto-merge
with the rebase strategy, preserving commit author sign-offs.
Strict, GitHub Actions-sourced required CI and PR policy checks must pass on an
up-to-date branch; the automated merger has no bypass. The read-only
`policy / ci / policy` check preserves author sign-offs, Conventional Commit titles,
review requirements and hold labels. Independent policy events run to completion,
so a metadata edit cannot cancel another check on the same commit. After a pass,
policy re-runs the other event's older failed verdict for the same head
(`actions: write`), so a withdrawn objection clears without a manual re-run. The shared
release-age policy remains active, and Renovate configuration updates require
manual merging. The custom merger and its commands remain retired.

Biome repair retains its existing App credentials and publication boundary.
A head pushed only with `GITHUB_TOKEN` can miss PR policy events; it remains blocked
until a supported App/user update produces complete CI and policy checks.

Successful default-branch `ci` completion triggers the existing Pages publisher.
Before building and immediately before publication, it verifies the live default
revision, CI workflow/repository provenance, newest successful run and attempt.
Failed, pending, cancelled, skipped, stale and PR-only CI cannot authorize a deploy.
Manual dispatch remains available for the current fully checked main commit.
The existing frozen build, published directory and custom domain are preserved.
Deployment-selection regression tests run in the mandatory quality lane.

Shared smoke owns readiness, deadlines and process-group cleanup; caller-owned
route/content assertions and all existing browser tests remain mandatory.
